Hey, itsmars.

Included are some 32x32 pixel cursors of a Medieval Gauntlet.

They're all edited versions of yd's "Pointers: part 5".

Included is also some cursors outlined in color, should you want to change it contextually;

▪ A yellow outline could be for when you're hovering over a quest item.
▪ Blue could be an openable door or chest.
▪ Red could be for hostile enemies.
▪ White could be for NPCs.

Lastly, I included four extra versions of the cursor, which were actually just layers in photoshop, as I worked towards my final product.

I don't use them, but they could be perfect for your game, or even better bases to work off of, if you wish to make more adjustments to them, in photoshop.

 

I used these in a video tutorial. Check it out here:
