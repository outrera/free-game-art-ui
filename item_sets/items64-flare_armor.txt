Here's a solid base set of armor icons divided into five equipment slots:
- Head
- Chest
- Hands (up to elbow)
- Legs
- Feet (up to knee)

In five flavors:
- Clothes
- Robes
- Leather
- Chainmail
- Plate

Each icon is 64x64 pixels.

This is a collaboration between four artists:

Clint Bellanger created the original models and raw renders for the others to paint over
Blarumyrran created the Leather Chest and Plate Chest
crowline (CrowLineStudio) created the Cloth set
Justin Nichol created the rest of the Robes, Leather, Chain, Plate sets
All have agreed to release these CC0 (Public Domain) to match the license originally chosen by Blarumyrran for the previous icons.

Created for Flare. The style is intended to be basically compatible with Wesnoth.

Extension of the OSARE weapon icons submission.
