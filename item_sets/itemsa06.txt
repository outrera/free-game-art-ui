A few icons I released a while back! Inspired by games such as Star Ocean and Tales of Phantasia with their beautiful, elaborate items. It's so inspiring! I always felt so immersed and compelled to find new items and examine them closely.

In fact I want to make 3D items like Star Ocean 2 one day : ))
