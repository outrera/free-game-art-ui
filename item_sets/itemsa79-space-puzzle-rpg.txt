We are releasing this asset pack from an open source game we created for the Corona SDK.

This is an open-source prototype of both a "match three" game and an old-school RPG with an infinite hallway and items to collect. It's not a complete game, but a jumping off point for folks that want to explore and learn modern game programming techniques in Lua with the Corona SDK.
