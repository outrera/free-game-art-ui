What do you do if you can't find free stuff that suits your taste or need? Of course, you create it yourself and then you share it!

I made some colorful 16x16 potions for your role playing games or else.

2 styles รก 5 qualities รก 10 colors. :)

EDIT: I modified (improved) the potions over 20 times since i first uploaded them. Luckily, OGA still had the first files, so i re-uploaded them, too. They have more bluish glasses, less visible corks and are less shiny. Be sure you download the correct file.

EDIT 2: Added transparent potion bottles with overlays for easy recoloring. Made by Borka223 (no attribution required). Thanks!
