Finding art for small hobby projects isn't easy. I ended up making these for my own game and they turned out all right so I am posting them here. You use them however you want.

 

There are 6 different icons. It is a .svg file so it should be easy to change yourself. There are also a few different sets of backgrounds and effects in the png file.
