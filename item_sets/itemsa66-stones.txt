A collection of 16 rune symbols, each embossed to look like brown stone.  Included is a set of the symbols by themselves, a set of each symbol surrounded by a stone border, two different seamless tile textures, and a master PSD file so you can edit or replace with your own symbols, glow effects, etc.

Part of an old project that didn't go anywhere.  Hopefully they will do some other project good.
