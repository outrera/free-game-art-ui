Here is a set of painterly drawn weapon icons (32x32px)

I initially made them for a game, but the development does not seem to go any further. So I am releasing them now here and hope they may be useful for someone else.

The archive contains the following 37 different weapons (*.png)

    4 * Longsword
    3 * Crossbow
    3 * Shortsword
    3 * Axe
    3 * Wooden staff
    3 * Spear
    3 * Claw
    3 * Hammer
    3 * Bow
    3 * Club
    3 * Dagger
    3 * Halbert

(matching armor icons can be found here: http://opengameart.org/content/armor-icons-32x32-px-painterly)

 
Update by request: Added layered gimp *xcf. files and *.png files with transparent background. (Attention: If an item looks wrong with a different background, it may be because it has transparency in it. Add something black behind it, or multi-duplicate the layer before adding a different background then.)

It should be a little bit easier to create item variations with this set (instead of the armor set mentioned before). I have used more layers here.
