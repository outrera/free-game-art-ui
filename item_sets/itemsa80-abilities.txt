I created some RPG ability icons for my project. There is a Zip file where I uploaded every icon in seperate file, and also included the SVG file where you can scale/edit every icon without problems. I used Inkscape to create them. When I'm done with some more programming in my project, I will create and upload further icons, and probaly not only Ability, but also Item icons. The Icons have size 64x64.
