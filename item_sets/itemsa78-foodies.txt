This is an update and an improvement to my other "foodie" set. This time, I organized the palette a bit more consistently, finishing those items with 23 colors. Also, there's no outline time time, as I decided that leaving room for it was taking pixels from the items themselves.

I came up with this idea one day that I was very very hungry, and decided to wait for dinner while thinking of my dinner itself! Hahahah!

As this one was more consistently done, I'll keep uploading it at every 8 new items I pixel \o/

As always, this is public domain, so it use, mofidy it, share it! \o/ It's yours!
