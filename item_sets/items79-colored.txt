This pack contains 32x32 and 32x64 RPG clutter, downsized (in the case of the pickaxe, mangled as well) and colorized from Daniel F. Walthall/Axebane's Free! Fantasy Stock Art.

The pickaxe, which is what I needed the most, I couldn't make look okay, but it'll serve as a placeholder until I actually learn to art. The hammer and scrolls may actually be usable. Also included as a bonus is a stack of books. Maybe you have giants in your game and they need bigger books? Either way, they won't agree to even look like the pickaxe if I downsize them further.

For those curious or interested in modifying the original pack, all of the art looks quite nice downsized to 128x. Going further than that requires some editing.
