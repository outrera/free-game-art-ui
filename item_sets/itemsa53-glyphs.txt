These symbols were originally made to be used on Rpgmaker 2003 as a replacement of the uncool symbols the program offers. Although anyone can use it in their RPGs. These are meant to be Font symbols, not a replacement for your traditional icons... but then again, why not? :)

If you use this art in your project, you must put CharlesGabriel in the credits and link back to CGArtsenal.
