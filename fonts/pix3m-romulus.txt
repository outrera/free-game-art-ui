The world needs more serifed bitmap fonts. It's annoying trying to find what I need (or want?) so I made my own. Total newbie at type design though and this took only an hours worth of screwing around, so I don't expect this font to be industry-standard.

Edit: Now with a lot more (latin) characters for the European users.

Used this site to make this: http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/

Though I probably want more appropriate tools for this.
