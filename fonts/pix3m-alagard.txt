And I felt the need to make another font... I can feel that I am gonna want a font like this for various projects. I could go with other bitmap gothic fonts but they tend to be incredibly difficult to read.

The name I came up for this was largely a random piece of gibberish that sounds like a name that wouldn't sound out of place in a medieval fantasy game. Dunno if I subconsciously stole that name from somewhere though.


Wanna have a closer look at how this font looks? Here's a specimen I made: https://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/178/d/f/pre_alagard2_by_pix3m-d6awmju.png

I might make more characters for accents and other fun stuff if requested. Limitations on the web applet I used to make this wouldn't give me the space to add them though, so I'll need to find new tools not so much focused on convenience.
