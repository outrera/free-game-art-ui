Very simple raster font.  8pt (max size 8x12 pixels).  Low printable ASCII (32 through 127 ... technically 126) represented.

Here it's a white font with black outline.  I'll be using it in a game with variable color backgrounds so the outline helps.

In the preview I use "-1px kerning" so that the black outline of adjacent characters overlap.

The .zip includes a definition file that shows the pixel width of each character.  Also includes the .xcf file.

To get the top and left corner of each character, the formula would be something similar to this:

top = (ascii - 32) / 16 * 12;

left = (ascii - 32) % 16 * 8;
