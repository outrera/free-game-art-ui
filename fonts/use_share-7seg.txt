Here's a bunch of pixel-art fonts that I haven't uploaded at one point. Unlike those uploaded before, they are simple images not arranged in an established font format.

8x8font: a futuristic-style 8-bit font.

7seg: a seven-segment 8x16 font with an alphanumeric character set.

font0: a tall 8x8 aliased font with Latin and Russian characters.

highdigits: a small set of italic digits.

lowerscript: an 8x16 italicized font with script-like italics.

segment: an experiment in creating a segmented font with less than 14 segments that would still show English and Russian characters adequately.
