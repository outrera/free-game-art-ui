These files are from my shoot-em-up game: Star Juggler, found at itch.io.
Made for the LOWREZJAM were participants needed to make a game with a size of 64x64px.

Numbers indicate wether it belonged to the Prototype (0) or the Alpha (1) version.

Notes:
  - There was no Background in the Prototype
  - Files without a number were the same on both versions (ex: MicroFont)
  - The Star (Players' projectile) was in the projectiles file in the case of the Prototype
  - The Microfont has letters and symbols with sizes ranging from 1x1 (.) to 5x5 (W)
