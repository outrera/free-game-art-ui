In addition to the weapons I posted earlier today (http://opengameart.org/content/weapon-icons-32x32px-painterly) , I have also some armor icons flying around. This time its not a complete set, but I hope its useful anyway.

Total: 21 icons:

    plate
    chain
    cloth
    leather
    3 necklaces
    3 rings.

Update by request:

Added transparent png-Files. Attention: Some icons may look wrong without the black background, because they have some transparency in them, and "use" the black from behind.

Added also xcf-Gimp files. Most of them are just with two layers (icon/background) but some have details on different layers (like jewels on the necklaces) to make the creation of variations a little bit easier.
