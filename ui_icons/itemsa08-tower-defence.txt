I noticed that is missing sprites for tower defenses. As one of the projects I was doing was a TD, and I've used a lot of site, time to return =). So if you like, just use.

And its my first try, so take it easy XD.

 
--- EDIT ---- 

I'm putting more 2 towers in the pack the "flower" like and the Eye of Sauron like =).
