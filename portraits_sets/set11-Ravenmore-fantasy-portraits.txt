Contains four portraits in 256x256, 128x128 & 64x64 size. Should be cool for RPG's or strategies.

-Human, Elf, Dwarf and Gnome.

This pack is somewhat based on the sprites I did for Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM). The easiest way to say 'thanks' is to help get us through Greenlight on Steam. We're 90% there as I write this!

As always, will expand this based on requests and feedback. Female versions? Evil races? Maybe some backgrounds or clothes/armors? Can happen! (though will take time). Let me know in the comments.

I'm always interested in working with indie game developers. Not for free or "a cut of the profits" though :)

Have fun! :)
