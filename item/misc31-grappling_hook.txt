While searching through the OGA database the other day, I noticed that there was no grappling hook of any kind. Since I needed something for my own project anyway, I created something in Inkscape, and make it available here.

This is nothing special, but it may be of some use for somebody someday. The SVG file is included in the zipfile.

 

The hook/anchor is based on the picture shown on the Wikipedia article, whereas the rope is copypasted from this.

No credit is required since it's public domain. But if it makes you feel better, "azureguy" will suffice. (again, this is entirely voluntary).
