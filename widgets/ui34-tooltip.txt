Hey, itsmars.

Included is the background, title bar and divider for the Tooltip I'll be making in my Youtube Video Tutorial.
It was heavily inspired by Path of Exile item Tooltips.

Font used is called "Dumbledor", from dafont.com

I'll link the corresponding video tutorial once I record it.
Check back later, or go subscribe! :)
