Hey, itsmars.

 

Included is a free "orb" or "globe" to use for displaying health & mana (or fury, wrath, spirit, arcane energy, etc.).

 

The "fill" .PNG is white by default, so that's the one to recolor (In your Game Dev Software / Photoshop).

 

Also included are two seamless "render clouds" which I use to give my liquid a "scrolling" appearance.

 

Check the setup out on Youtube!

Added a new, darker Panel with action bar slots. PSD is included, check it out!
