An assortment of paper backgrounds for book pages or popup windows I'm using in my project.  There is an Adobe Photoshop PSD file included so you can customize the drop shadow, the sidebar, or the runes as you see fit.

Some of these images are based on free CC-BY 3.0 textures from darkwood67.  You can see them and all of his/her other amazing work here: http://darkwood67.deviantart.com/gallery/ -so give him/her the credit.
