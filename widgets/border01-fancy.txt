Here's possibly the nicest asset I made for my Game Jam entry here on OGA, the border I made for the "Tithon Panel" (what pops up to show when you're looking at Tithon, a character from my game entry)

Included also is the source .krita file (https://krita.org/en/) from the digital painting app that I used to make it, along with what the panel framed in-game. WHo knows it might spark your imagination like how other art on this site has sparked mine!

 

If you use this in a project of yours, I'd love to hear about it! Pop a comment down below if you want to give me warm and fuzzy feelings!
