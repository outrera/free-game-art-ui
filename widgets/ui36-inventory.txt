Hey, itsmars.

Included is the Inventory / Character Sheet I'll be using for my Youtube Video Tutorials.
It was heavily inspired by the Diablo series, Torchlight series & Path of Exile.

The Inventory has 32 slots, at 64x64 pixels.

The Character Sheet has 10 EquipSlots, at 81x81 pixels
(Strange dimensions, but I'll be resizing the equipment icons in Unity).

My chosen equipslots will be...
Head/Chest/Gloves/Boots/MainHand/Neck/Ring/Ring/Belt/OffHand,
but feel free to open the .PSD and resize the EquipSlots to make room for more

(with only 10 EquipSlots, I left out room for Cape/Shoulders/Shirt/Writs/Legs/Trinket/Tabard, etc.).

I'll link the corresponding video tutorial once I record it.
Check back later, or go subscribe! :)

Update 1.1!
I decided against using transparent inventory icons, so I added a "blank slot" image.

edit: Actually, I'm going to stick with transparent items.
I will leave the BlankSlot.png because I worked on it for so long.

Update 1.2!
Added some rarity borders. Colors inspired by PoE.
