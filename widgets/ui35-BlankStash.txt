Hey, itsmars.

Included is the Bank / Stash I'll be using for my Youtube Video Tutorials.
It was heavily inspired by Diablo 2.

The Inventory has 64 slots, at 64x64 pixels.

I'll link the corresponding video tutorial once I record it.
Check back later, or go subscribe! :)

Update 1.1!
I decided against using transparent inventory icons, so I added a "blank slot" image.

edit: Actually, I'm going to stick with transparent items.
I will leave the BlankSlot.png because I worked on it for so long.
