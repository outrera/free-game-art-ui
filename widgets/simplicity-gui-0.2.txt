Some simple pixel art GUI elements:

Frame (ridge) with gray background
Inset (at the same time button frame) black
Default, active and disabled buttons in red, green and blue
4 Icons for Buttons: Up/Down Arrows, CW/CCW Arrows
Letters A-Z, Number 0-9 for use on the default gray background
Screw heads
Preview image is at 2x scale.
Frame and inset are sliced up for use as 9-patch.
Buttons can easily be sliced up in the same way.
Drawn with DawnBringer's famous 32 color palette.
They are programmer art quality level, I guess.
Everything comes as tidy GIMP files.

I would highly appreciate if you let me know where you are using these, but you don't need to.
