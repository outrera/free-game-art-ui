A bunch of small cursors I made when I was coming up with ideas a while back. I was looking for one that would match what I was working on. I found it later on, but it's not here because I intend to use it.

These are made using the colours from DawnBringers 16 colour palette.

Ignore the red, I like to work on a solid colour background that's easy on the eye and for me that's typically red, grey or brown.

Enjoy.
